## Description
This project is aimed to develop **a Machine Learning Model that would be able to predict the critical time (in days) when the player is more likely to stop playing the game.**
So we can then act accordingly. Providing the player with some special rewards in order to increase the player retention.

## Technologies used
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/)

## Data Visualization

## Roadmap
- [x] Exploratory Data Analysis

- Applying Machine Learning Model for prediction:
- (Using Cross Validation)
- [x] Decission Tree Regressor 
- [x] KNN for Regression
- [x] Random Forest
- [x] Linear Regression
- [x] Adaboost

- Creating a Neural Network:
- [x] Feed Forward Neural Network

- [ ] Filter data by max_played_days between 1-15
- [ ] Apply models to filtered data

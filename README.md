## Description
This project is aimed to develop **a Machine Learning Model that would be able to predict the critical time (in days) when the player is more likely to stop playing the game.**
So we can then act accordingly. Proving the player with some special rewards in order to increase the player retention.

## Technologies used
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
